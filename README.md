# CUDA100

This repository contains the code developed during my 100 days of CUDA programming challenge.

0. [hello_world](./000_hello_world): Test program to verify that the GPU is working correctly.
1. [vector_add](./001_vector_add): Efficiently adds two vectors using the GPU.
2. [matrix_multiply](./002_matrix_multiply): Efficiently multiplies two matrices using the GPU.
3. [matrix_transpose](./003_matrix_transpose): Efficiently transposes a matrix using the GPU.
4. [color_inversion](./004_color_inversion): Efficiently inverts the color of an image using the GPU.

## Resources

List of resources used during the challenge:

- Book "CUDA by Example"
- Book "Programming Massively Parallel Processors"
- CUDA FreeCodeCamp Course https://youtu.be/86FAWCzIe_4?si=37G_SkoQEQp8dSod
- GPU Mode Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@GPUMODE/videos 

The examples were developed on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 with CUDA 12.8 and driver 570.195.03 (Ubuntu 22.04)
